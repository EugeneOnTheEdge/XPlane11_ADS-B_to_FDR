# XPlane11 ADS-B to FDR
This software converts a given ADS-B flight radar data (usually given by FlightRadar24 soon after an airline accident) to a playable FDR file (Flight Data Recorder) for X-Plane 11 PC Flight Simulator.

Now you can see what the pilot "sees" just before their aircraft goes down.

NOTE: ADS-B does NOT record all parameters like the FDR does (for example: N1/N2/N3/N4, flaps, autopilot settings, trim, rudder, etc). It only records basic infos such as time, position (lat + long), ground speed, callsign, altitude, heading and V/S.


Have a look at JT610_Granular_ADSB_Data.csv for a real-world example of ADS-B data. The file provides basic parameters recorded in a Lion Air JT610 which plunged into an Indonesian sea shortly after take off back in 2018.
